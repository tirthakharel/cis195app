- **How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least 2 concrete examples**

    and SwiftyJSON, and programmatically designing views.

- **What class material do you review? List at least 2 concrete examples**
  - I reviewed networking and Firebase
  
- **Do you plan on continuing to work on this project?**
  - Yes my final project will be submitted May 1st, but after that I plan on improving it and maybe submitting it to the App Store.
